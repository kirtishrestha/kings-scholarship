## GPA score of students at King's Study
### A. Problem Statement
1) Building a logistic regression model to assign a score between 0 and 100 to each of the students which can be used by the King's College Nepal to provide scholarships to potential candidate students.
Creating a model that can adjust according to the college's requirements:
a) When the college's mission is to support academic excellence and financial need, the focus is to identify all deserving students for scholarship opportunities.
b) When the college's commitment centers on fiscal responsibility and the equitable distribution of resources, the priority is to carefully manage scholarship allocations to ensure fairness and sustainability.
